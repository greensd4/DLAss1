1. MLP allowing us by using non-linear function to divide the information that can not be divided by linear functions. with using MLP we need an algorithm to calculate the error at the output and to the spread it to the network layers and then getting better accuracies.

2. the accuracy of unigram model is lower than the bi-gram model (unigram accuracy was around 40% and bigram was around 85%). 

3.we have tried to verify that the MLP can learn the XOR problem. we found out that we need at least 90 epcohes.
